# Lung-Cancer-Detection

• Trained a CNN model to predict whether a CT ( computerized
tomography ) scan image of a Lungs is of benign or malignant nature

• Used Otsu’s algorithm to perform image segmentation on CT scan
images of Lungs by extracting the Region Of Interest

• Working on to train another model using NiftyNet ( a pre-trained model which is
trained on large medical image dataset ) using Transfer Learning
